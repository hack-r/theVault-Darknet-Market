# The Vault Community Edition (theVault CE)
-------------------------------------------

Here you will find a fully functional darknet market/store. 

## What's included?

1. A fully functional, darknet-ready market based on PHP 8.3 and Laravel 11.
2. Support for Laravel 12, when it launches at the end of this month (February, 2025).
3. Admin panel.
4. Multi-seller support.
5. Captchas.
6. Semi-automated installation.
7. Quick-start .sql database backup of the demo site (this can be easier than seeder data for bootstrapping).
8. Server config example (nginx).
9. Support for multiple search backends (elasticsearch for privacy and algolia for speed; pure SQL is also supported but not recommended).
10. Optional support for Redis.
11. Featured product module (integrated but unimplemented in the demo configuration).
12. Parent and child product categories.
13. Convenience functions for listing vendors and products (top, rising, newest, etc.) primarily using Eloquent.
14. Notes to assist with troubleshooting and common administration tasks.
15. Dispute resolution tools.

This version is essentially Eckmar's Marketplace v1 upgraded to PHP8 with a few critical bugfixes from Goldhat, and integrating the Featured Products module from EM v2.
