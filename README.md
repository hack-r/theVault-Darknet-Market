Welcome to **theVault**! This is a prototype darknet vendor store inspired by:

1. Goldhat Free Market. <img src="goldhat.png" alt="Goldhat Free Market" style="width: 25px; height: 25px;">
2. The 2024 speculative medical thriller ["Baby X" by Kira Peikoff](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/baby-x-kira-peikoff/1143604735), which explores a near-future darknet vendor store selling DNA in wake of advances in fertilization technologies. Available on Amazon, Audible, and Barnes & Noble.

Goldhat was a legal darknet market-like store launched in 2020, which was forked from Eckmar's Marketplace. The project was only launched as a beta (no sales) to avoid potential legal liability. It included a major PHP upgrade (from v5 to v8) as well as a security enhancements with significant hardening of Nginx. Eckmar's project was orphaned following the release of PHP8 due to breaking changes. Goldhat restricted user-to-user communications and implemented other safeguards to prevent abuse during its public beta.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**theVault** is a transformation of previous projects into a fully functional vendor store. It builds upon the foundations laid by Eckmar's Market and Goldhat Free Market, updating the codebase to utilize **Laravel 11** and **PHP 8.3.x**.

This project has been tested on Debian and Fedora. Fedora is recommended on the basis that Debian is cruddy and basic. It probably runs fine on almost any linux but you'll need to update the installer commands (change dnf or apt to whatever you're using and map the package names to those for your distro).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Modern Framework**: Built on Laravel 11 and PHP 8.3.16 for enhanced performance and maintainability.
- **Elasticsearch Vectorstore**: Fast searching with the newest elasticsearch (currently 8.17).
- **OpenJDK**: Updated Java, bundled with elasticsearch for compatibility.
- **Redis**: Optional Redis 7.2.7 support for improved app performance.

## üì¶ Installation

To get started with **theVault**, follow these steps:

1. Request to pay $99 for the project (XMR, LTC, BTC, or Zelle).
2. Deploy on any Linux VM supporting Tor with at 2GB RAM (Fedora or Debian recommended).
3. Use the automated installation scripts in `install` and see the .txt files for notes and useful commands.

Features:
1. Admin panel.
2. Store or Market mode.
3. Fast search with a selection of local or hosted providers (elasticsearch, algolia, etc.).
4. Parent and child categories.
5. Catpcha.
6. Load-balancer support.
7. Mneumonics.
8. XMR and BTC integration with wrapper-based drop-in support for other currencies.
9. PHP 8.x and Laravel 11/12 support.

For additional help with Redis, check out this article: https://linuxcapable.com/install-redis-on-fedora-linux/

The process is identical for Debian, but uses apt and package names end with -dev in Debian where they are -devel for Fedora. The installer will attempt to directly install elasticsearch for you, but I recommend to comment that out and use either the provided repo file for a dnf/yum-based installation or use the Docker container from https://elastic.co. Other installation strategies are also available on their website.

	sudo dnf install --enablerepo=elasticsearch elasticsearch

## üé© Friendly Advice

Big Brother leverages the Eye of Sauron and has many dungeons. The darknet is filled with hackers and LEAs. If you're thinking of using this code to run a drug market/store or other arguably illegal activities, please rethink it. You'll get yourself into trouble. Use this to learn or to give the so-called 'dark net' some much needed original, non-illegal functionality. Give the gift of possible anonymity to a legal service. If you would like to invest and want a few ideas as well as a business partner, drop me a line.
