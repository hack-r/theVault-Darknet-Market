You'll need to update elasticsearch's .yml to disable SSL/HTTPS and secure_password if you're not using SSL (which most tor services don't). If you still get an SSL related error, add this to your .yml:

	xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: false

Unless you have lots of available memory (at least 4GB, but probably 8GB given this isn't the only thing running) you'll want to limit memory usage in java. 

	nano /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options

There you can limit the memory:

	-Xms512m
	-Xmx512m

You can change the values to any limit you'd like.
