Now you need to edit or create the .env file in /var/www/thevault (or whatever you called this folder-or, if you're wisely keeping your source files elsewhere and just copying them to that location, edit the source and copy it over).

It should look like this:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=marketplace
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=password

Optionally, include the following if you're using Redis:

CACHE_DRIVER=redis
